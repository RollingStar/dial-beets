# Info

My [beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets) config and associated files. I don't expect this to be set-and-forget useful to anyone except me. However, with minor changes you can make this config suit your needs as well. I hope it is a good demonstration of many of beets' advanced features.

# Installation

* config.yaml goes [here](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/config.html)
