# Info

My [beets](https://github.com/beetbox/beets) config and associated files. I don't expect this to be set-and-forget useful to anyone except me. However, with minor changes you can make this config suit your needs as well. I hope it is a good demonstration of many of beets' advanced features.

# Installation

* config.yaml goes [here](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/config.html)
* orig_date.py and copyartifactspy3.py go [here](http://beets.readthedocs.io/en/v1.4.5/dev/plugins.html?highlight=plugins), or search your computer for the "beetsplug" folder.
* You may find it useful to install the titlecase package. It is used in the custom alb_title field.
